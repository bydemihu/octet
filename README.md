# OCTET
### OCTET takes place in a speculative world where groups of 8 humans form one distributed-intelligence organism for collaboration-based survival.

It's the far future, and human greed has resulted in overconsumption and destruction that led to ecological collapse and the decline of human civilization. To survive, players form Octets, drawing inspiration from the octopi and their neural structures to learn how to make choices for the benefit of the collective as autonomous agents. The objective: balance personal interest with the good of the group through your choices and survive all of the scenarios to the end.

### SETUP

8 players sit in a circle, connected to a TENS unit via electrodes on the skin that deliver small muscle-stimulating shocks. The game is accessed on a broswer via personal mobile device, where players are presented with a scenario and two options they can take. If the players collaborate poorly as a result of selfish behavior, the entire collective suffers: voltage from the TENS increases to viscerally embody the shared consequences of individualistic thinking.
